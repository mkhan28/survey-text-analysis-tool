# survey-text-analysis-tool
Many surveys consist of open-ended questions which offer rich, qualitative data that have the potential to provide unfamiliar insight on a topic. Given a large sample size, this type of questions may end up having a large amount of text responses which might not be feasible for researchers to read through before they can extract any valuable insight. Despite having modern computing power and advanced text mining techniques, analyzing text responses still involves several steps of pre-processing, cleaning, and applying statistical procedures and can be very labor-intensive particularly for researchers who conduct several surveys each year. This text analysis tool will allow you to easily analyze text responses in a survey with minimal effort.
